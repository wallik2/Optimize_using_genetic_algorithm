## Inspiration
Nowaday, trends of being healthy is so hot, and there are a lot of products that promote your health. Fiber is known as a nutrient that is very useful to our health, while (monosaccharide) sugar is harmful.
Most of the healthy foods product have a high number in fiber, but also high in sugar as well, so our goal here is to maximize fiber but limit the sugar consumption 

## Objective function

- 🥬🌰  Maximize the number of diet fiber (g)🍄🧅🥦

## Constraint

- 🍬 Limit the number of sugar (g)🍭

## Scenario 1
**Story** :
> Imagine you have **40 limited food items** and you want to be healthy by 
> maximize the fiber per day

> However, you only can hold for **8 foods** to make a meal for some reason, 
> also you don't need to consume sugar exceed than **25g** 

Here's how we solve this problem given these 8 foods using Genetic algorithm, see how we have done it in [This Google Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1rd343DhzGwCBlFTCBJoENMps0vnWplNk?usp=sharing)
